# Delaunay-Triangulation
[Delaunay Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation#cite_note-hurtado-9) in Python using Bowyer–Watson algorithm.

In computational geometry, the [Bowyer–Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm) is a method for computing the Delaunay triangulation of a finite set of points in any number of dimensions. The algorithm can be also used to obtain a Voronoi diagram of the points, which is the dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation.

It is written with pure Python using pyGame to visualize the triangualtion. You can find more about pyGame from [here](https://www.pygame.org/).
